# Internet and Web

![Internet and Web](1.jpg)

The Internet is a platform through which different computers around the world can connect to each other. In fact, the Internet was formed to meet the human need for remote communication. Humanity's need for remote communication was gradually met with the advancement of technology, with the telegraph for transmitting text messages, the telephone for transmitting voice messages, and the fax for transmitting text and video messages. However, with the advent of computers, there was also a need for these computers to communicate with each other. So as a result, computers must be connected to each other so that they can receive information from each other and become, in the sense of a network. So we understood that the Internet is a platform for transmitting information remotely. In computer networks that are connected via the Internet, there are two problems that require two-way sending and receiving of information. That is, one person using a computer and using the Internet Protocol (IP), the target computer would send specific information to that person with the attention of the second person. Second, this information was not available to everyone and the existence of a receiver and sender of information was required. So there was a need for a space where information was accessible to everyone and information from all over the world was interconnected to create a huge information network that is today called the **web**. Another point is that the Internet was created to facilitate communication, but the Web was invented to make information available. Other services such as email, file transfer protocol (FTP),remote control of computers, etc. are also provided on the Internet.

**Don't confuse the Web with the Internet. The Internet was a platform that allowed computers around the world to communicate, but the Web is a collection of websites that are accessed using a platform called the Internet.**

# How can I use the Web?

**Client**: As a user, you can connect to the Internet from any device, such as a desktop computer, laptop, or even a smartphone.

**Internet**: The World Wide Web is a network that connects these devices and allows for the exchange of information.

**Server:** A powerful computer that stores website files. These files include text, images, videos, and other elements that make up a web page.

# **The Process is as Follows**

# 1.User request

- You enter a website address (for example, [www.youtub.com](http://www.youtub.com/)) into your browser.
- Your browser sends this address as a request to the internet.

# 2.Server Search

- The Internet uses the **Domain** Name System (**DNS**) to find the numeric (**IP**) address for that domain.
- **DNS** is like a phone book that maps domain names to IP addresses.

# 3.Connecting to the server

- Your browser uses the IP address to connect to the server where the website files are stored.
- Your browser requests the server to send the content of the page you want.

# 4.Send Information

- The server sends the required information (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) to your browser.
- This information is in the form of code that the browser can understand.

# 5.View in browser

- The browser interprets these codes and displays the web page in a form that is visible to you.

# **Website Domain**: your online identity

A domain name is the address that users type into their browser to access your website. This address is a unique name that is linked to a specific IP address. An IP address is a numeric address that every device connected to the Internet has and is used to identify that device on the World Wide Web.

# Components of a Domain

**(Protocol)**: This section specifies what protocol is used to communicate. It is usually HTTPS, which indicates a secure and encrypted connection.

**(Subdomain):** An optional part of a domain that is used to better organize a website. For example, www is a common subdomain.

**(Domain Name)**: The main part of the domain that identifies your website name. For example, in the address [https://www.youtube.com/](https://www.youtube.com/), the [youtube.com](http://youtube.com) part is the domain name.

**(Path)**: This section specifies which specific page or file on your website should be displayed. For example, /info/about.html is the path that points to the About Us page.

# **Domain level**

**Top-level domain (TLD)**: It is the last part of the domain and usually indicates the type of organization or country. For example, .com, .org, .net, .ir, etc.

**Second-level domain (SLD)**: This is the part of the domain that usually represents the brand name or topic of the website.

**Third-level domain (Subdomain)**: It is a subset of the second-level domain.
